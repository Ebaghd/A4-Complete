O'Neil writes: "The ranking, in short, was destiny.... Now the vast reputational
ecosystem of colleges and universities was overshadowed by a single column of
numbers" (p. 53). Briefly discuss how a ranking of colleges can create feedback loops that problematically undermine the goal of the original ranking.

> A ranking of colleges can create feedback loops that problematically undermine the goal of the original ranking by not accurately representing the merits of each college. College rankings often do not do the colleges justice, as colleges are unique with various strengths and perks. However, college students only see the rankings by number according to an algorithm. The feedback loop that results is started with a bad ranking or review. That bad ranking/review can lower the college's reputation and top students/professors would avoid it. The ranking of the college would fall further.

## Think: Envisioning Cards
If you like, please work in a group of 2 or more.

Please consider the Natural Amenities Scale, which was discussed in class (see slides in lecture-7 folder) and consider the possible uses and impacts of the scale (optional: see report in lecture-7 folder). Explore the Envisioning Cards and select three cards - any three cards you want. How do the cards that you have selected clarify possible impacts or raise new questions. [6 points]

> (1) **Direct Stakeholders -** Those who directly interact with the system. What impact can a scale which measures the physical characteristics of a county to enhance the area have on direct stakeholders/property owners?

> (2)  **Choose desired values -** Often systems are intentionally designed to support specific values. Can this system favor certain areas in a particular way and how can this impact the system?

> (3)  **Elicit Stakeholder Views and Values -** Both direct and indirect stakeholders may hold values that are different than those of the designers. What impact can land-owner/stakeholder views have on the Natural Amenities Scale?
